		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>
		<p>The <strong>giant</strong> squid <em>(genus: Architeuthis)</em> is a 
		deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size <em>(see Deep-sea gigantism)</em>: recent estimates put the maximum size at <strong>13m</strong> <em>(43ft)</em> for females and <strong>10m</strong> <em>(33ft)</em> for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles <em>(second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14m (46ft), one of the largest living organisms)</em>. The mantle is about <strong>2m</strong> <em>(6.6ft)</em> long <em>(more for females, less for males)</em>, and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about <strong>5m</strong> <em>(16ft)</em>.</p> 
		<p>Claims of specimens measuring <strong>20m</strong> <em>(66ft)</em> or more have not been scientifically documented. On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr> of Tokyo, Japan and the <abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr> took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr> and <abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr> successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
